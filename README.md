### File Management, Optimization, and Protection in Server Environments. 

####   This project proposes the development of a Python-based automation application that optimizes file management on a server by deleting empty and duplicate files. The system will automatically scan the server for redundant files and remove them, freeing up storage space and improving data organization. Additionally, the system will integrate a malicious file detection feature, utilizing virus definitions to identify potential threats. 
####   Every Sunday, the system will generate a comprehensive log file detailing the deleted files, including malicious files detected, and send it to a designated email address. This log file will provide administrators with valuable insights into file activity and security breaches, enabling prompt action to be taken. The proposed system aims to enhance server efficiency, reduce storage costs, and strengthen security measures by detecting and reporting malicious files.
